            <h2>Preface</h2>
            This game is an attempt to recreate an encouter with a Goblin in the format of Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (D&D5E).
            Dungeons and Dragons is as much about storytelling as it is about the odds. The JavaScript program that I've created follows
            the basic rules of D&D5E, such as assigning you an armor class, hit points, and an attack that deals a randomly determined amount
            of damage based on dice rolls. Don't worry, though! You don't have to do any of the math and tracking that normally comes with D&D 
            to play this game. All you have to do is relax, read the story, and roll the dice!

            There will be a small paragraph of story presented with each option.<br><br>

            There may also be directions from the Dungeon Master. In a normal Dungeons and Dragons game, the Dungeon Master is another person who
            controls the direction of the game and the non-playable-characters that you encounter. In this game, the program is the Dungeon Master,
            and has some predetermined dialogue that you can explore!<br><br>

                    You and your party have spent the night in a cave deep in the forest. You've been on the road for a few days, and the closest
                    town is still a few more days away. You can hear Uther snoring lazily as you stir. The oaf must've fallen asleep on watch duty
                    again. That's alright, you're awake now, and the camp seems none-the-worse. You get up and go a small ways from the camp for 
                    your morning constitution. On your way back to the cave, you see a rather large, fuzzy creature wearing armor heading towards you!

            You can see the Gnoll in the distance making its way towards your camp. You have the time to catch up to it, and you think you can knock it out
            before it alerts anything else nearby. What do you do?
